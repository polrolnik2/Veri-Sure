# The golden-free scorecard for k1-dcfsm

Every number above the audit line was produced by a rule reading only artifacts
the specification produced: nine designs written independently from the spec by
agents forbidden to open any other design, and the recorded traces of those
designs. **No reference, no equivalence verdict, and no trace of one enters any
of them.** The audit column is computed last, feeds nothing, and is reported
because a span without its false-reject rate is meaningless — never because it
approves a result.

## 1. The metrics, and why these

| metric | definition | golden-free? |
|---|---|---|
| **span** | requirements with at least one check in the set, of 87 (2 removed: their state is compiled out of this build and proved unreachable by k-induction) | yes |
| **acceptance** | how many of the nine designs the set accepts | yes |
| **set blindness** | of the (pair, testpoint) cells where two designs DISAGREE on a declared output, the share where NO check in the set objects to either | yes |
| *audit* | *checks that decide on the reference and convict it* | **no — calibration only** |

**SET BLINDNESS IS THE COMPLETENESS NUMBER AND IT REPLACED A WRONG ONE.**
Blindness was first scored per check. Adding 17 checks each measured *less blind
than its parent* took the blind-check count from 121 to 136 — because a set
gains a blind check whenever it gains a check. Rejection is a union, so a metric
that worsens when you add a check is measuring the denominator. Set blindness
composes: adding a check can only close holes.

## 2. The sets

| set | selected by | checks | span | accepts of 9 | **set blindness** | *audit* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule B *(earlier)* | population | 68 | 52% | — | — | *10%* |
| CEIL2 | **the reference** | 163 | 68% | **0** | **56.9%** | *0%* |
| FREE (convicts ≤2 of 7) | population | 167 | 70% | 1 (design B) | — | *13%* |
| **ZERO (convicts 0 of 7)** | **population** | **126** | **56%** | 1 (design B) | **99.8%** | ***0%*** |

CEIL2 is a **ceiling**, not a score: it is selected by asking the reference which
checks to keep. It is reported to bound what the corpus can do, exactly as the
goal permits golden to calibrate.

## 3. The golden-free soundness rule, and a retraction

The rule previously quoted here — *convicts at most 2 of the population* — was
measured 59 of 59 sparing the reference and called the best golden-free
soundness instrument. Re-run over all 594 corpus bodies instead of the 114 that
had been scored:

| golden-free rule | checks | *audit* |
|---|---|---|
| convicts **0** of 7 | **126** | ***0 = 0%*** |
| convicts 1 of 7 | 23 | *48%* |
| convicts 2 of 7 | 18 | *61%* |

**The step is at ZERO and it is sharp, not monotone.** A cut fitted at 2 on a
fifth of the corpus read as perfect and is 13% false-reject on the whole of it.

## 4. What the rule costs, which is the session's central result

    CEIL2   selected by the reference       set blindness  56.9%
    ZERO    selected golden-free            set blindness  99.8%

The golden-free set objects to **12 of 5,656** disagreements. The mechanism is
the rule itself: *convicts none of the population* is, by definition, *does not
discriminate on the population*. **Selecting for predictable soundness is
selecting for blindness — the same predicate read twice.**

## 5. What is nonetheless real

The ZERO set objects **11 times to design L**, which was held out of the seven
that selected it. Sound *and* discriminating on an unseen design, from a rule
that read no reference, is a property measured at 3–5% per check across this
project and never before obtained golden-free at set level.

## 6. Routes closed, each with the measurement that closed it

| route | result |
|---|---|
| more stimulus | **0** — every uncaught disagreement is on a testpoint the suite already runs, where two designs already differ. The evidence is present and the set is silent on it |
| re-authoring checks (39 calls, with a witness) | **0 cells newly reached.** The rewrites' objections were a strict subset of what the set already caught |
| selection over the whole corpus | **0** of 431 unused bodies close a hole while demonstrably sound. 296 close one; 288 convict the reference; 2 never decide on it |
| a golden-free completeness certificate | the pair instrument RANKS blindness at Spearman **+0.908** but its CLEAN cell is 5 of 8, and all five correct cleans are clean *by silence* |

## 7. The metric is validated against editor progress — a matched pair

Two editors, **the same unchecked starting design**, same model, same brief and
budget; the only difference is which set drove them.

| set | **blindness** | objections | testpoints differing | grade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CEIL2 163, reference-selected | 56.9% | 22 → 5 (−77%) | 279 → 190 (**−32%**) | `DIFFERS` |
| ZERO 126, golden-free | 99.8% | 11 → 1 (−91%) | 279 → 271 (**−3%**) | `DIFFERS` |

Both grades taken in a clean run directory with three miter pins green in the
same process. **The golden-free set spent 91% of its objections and moved the
design 3%.**

So set blindness is not a description of a set after the fact: it says in
advance how much of a design's divergence a loop driven by that set will close.
That was pre-registered before the second run was dispatched, and the run landed
on it. **This is the proxy metric the goal asks for — chosen by how well it
facilitates the editor succeeding, computable from spec-derived designs alone,
and validated against what the loop achieves rather than against how a set looks.**

*Trial counts are an output, not a confound: 10 of 21 and 19 of 21, neither
stopping for budget. A blinder set stops giving feedback sooner. Scope is two
runs — the gap is large and monotone, and two points do not establish a slope.*

## 8. The trade is a curve, not two points — and the reference is off it

Section 2's four sets were built separately and read as anecdotes. They are four
samples of ONE golden-free knob, and sweeping it end to end turns the trade into
a measurement. The knob: **keep a check that convicts at most t of the seven
independently written spec-derived designs.**

**The sweep reproduces three of the separately-built sets byte for byte** —
t = 0 is ZERO, t = 2 is FREE, t = 7 is the minimum-blindness set — which is what
says it is the same instrument rather than a new one. The five intermediate
thresholds had never been scored.

| t | checks | span of 87 | **set blindness** | population objections | spread/mean | *audit* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 126 | 55 = 63% | **99.8%** | 0 – 0 | — | *0 = 0.0%* |
| 1 | 149 | 63 = 72% | 93.5% | 0 – 19 | 578% | *11 = 7.4%* |
| 2 | 167 | 68 = 78% | 66.5% | 0 – 32 | 380% | *22 = 13.2%* |
| 3 | 171 | 68 = 78% | 64.2% | 0 – 34 | 335% | *23 = 13.5%* |
| 4 | 179 | 69 = 79% | 61.9% | 7 – 34 | 184% | *27 = 15.1%* |
| 5 | 188 | 70 = 80% | 52.7% | 11 – 34 | 109% | *27 = 14.4%* |
| **6** | **201** | **71 = 82%** | **40.4%** | 22 – 38 | 50% | *38 = 18.9%* |
| 7 | 464 | 73 = 84% | **0.0%** | 285 – 301 | **5.4%** | *299 = 64.4%* |

**BLINDNESS FALLS AND THE AUDIT RISES ACROSS THE WHOLE SWEEP.** Completeness
and soundness are not two properties a better rule could optimise jointly.
Golden-free, on this corpus, they are one knob read in two directions.

### The cumulative table overstates how orderly that is

The thresholds nest, so the audit **count** cannot fall as *t* grows — its
monotonicity is a property of the construction and carries no information. The
**rate** is not monotone either; it dips at t = 5. Per bucket rather than
cumulative:

| the check convicts | checks | convict the reference |
|---|---|---|
| 0 of 7 | 126 | **0 = 0.0%** |
| 1 to 6 of 7 | 75 | 38 = **50.7%** |
| 7 of 7 | 263 | **261 = 99.2%** |

**The rule is exact at both ends and a coin flip in between.** Convicting none
of the population spares the reference 126 times out of 126; convicting all of
it convicts the reference 261 times out of 263. In the middle band the rule has
no signal at all.

**And that middle band is exactly where the blindness reduction lives** — those
75 checks are everything between the sound-and-blind set and t = 6, and they
carry blindness from 99.8% to 40.4%. So the trade is not a smooth price to pay;
it is a region where the golden-free rule stops discriminating altogether, and
every point inside it is bought blind.

### And CEIL2 is not on this curve, which is what the reference is worth

CEIL2 is **56.9% blind at an audit of zero**. To reach 52.7% golden-free costs
14.4% false rejection. The arithmetic closes exactly: 161 of CEIL2's 163 checks
lie inside t = 6, t = 6 holds exactly 38 audit failures, and CEIL2's other two
are the only two checks in the corpus that convict all seven and still spare the
reference. So **CEIL2 is t = 6 with its 38 audit failures removed and those two
added, with nothing left over — and removing the 38 takes blindness from 40.4%
back to 56.9%.** Those 38 checks close 933 disagreement cells and nothing sound
replaces them.

### The second opposition, and it is independent of soundness

Set blindness asks whether SOME check objects somewhere in a disagreeing cell.
It says nothing about whether the objection COUNT orders designs — and at the
completeness floor it does not. **Eight designs that differ across a large
fraction of the suite are separated by sixteen checks of 464.** The bodies that
close the last holes convict every design, so they contribute a constant to
every score.

So a loop descending the raw count of a complete set descends a signal with a 5%
dynamic range. **Completeness and drivability are opposed too, for a different
reason than the audit.** What is measured is a limit on the RAW COUNT, which is
what every loop here has descended; a weighting or a per-requirement fold could
in principle recover a gradient it does not have.

## 9. The bottom line

**Completeness cannot be assured golden-free on this corpus, and section 8
makes that a measured curve rather than an inference from two sets.** Every
golden-free step toward completeness is a step into false rejection, monotonically,
across all eight thresholds — so the obstruction is a trade rather than a missing
instrument that a thirteenth route might supply. The blindness ranker is
excellent and the soundness rule is perfect at n=126; composing them yields a set
that is sound, spans 56% of the specification, and is blind to 99.8% of the
disagreements it is shown. The 288 corpus bodies that *do* close holes all convict
a correct design.

**And the reference is doing work no rule over the population reproduces.** A
set at 56.9% blindness and zero false rejection exists; it is reachable only by
asking the reference which checks to keep. That is the sharpest statement this
corpus supports of what a golden-free pipeline gives up.

**A second, independent opposition:** the set that reaches the completeness floor
cannot order the population by its own count — 5.4% dynamic range over eight
visibly different designs — so completeness costs drivability as well as
soundness.

**Scope.** One design, one corpus of 594 bodies, one population of nine. Every
figure names its denominator. Nothing here is claimed for i2c, which remains
unmeasured because no i2c run retains traces.
