# The golden-free scorecard for k1-dcfsm

Every number above the audit line was produced by a rule reading only artifacts
the specification produced: nine designs written independently from the spec by
agents forbidden to open any other design, and the recorded traces of those
designs. **No reference, no equivalence verdict, and no trace of one enters any
of them.** The audit column is computed last, feeds nothing, and is reported
because a span without its false-reject rate is meaningless — never because it
approves a result.

## 1. The metrics, and why these

| metric | definition | golden-free? |
|---|---|---|
| **span** | requirements with at least one check in the set, of 87 (2 removed: their state is compiled out of this build and proved unreachable by k-induction) | yes |
| **acceptance** | how many of the nine designs the set accepts | yes |
| **set blindness** | of the (pair, testpoint) cells where two designs DISAGREE on a declared output, the share where NO check in the set objects to either | yes |
| *audit* | *checks that decide on the reference and convict it* | **no — calibration only** |

**SET BLINDNESS IS THE COMPLETENESS NUMBER AND IT REPLACED A WRONG ONE.**
Blindness was first scored per check. Adding 17 checks each measured *less blind
than its parent* took the blind-check count from 121 to 136 — because a set
gains a blind check whenever it gains a check. Rejection is a union, so a metric
that worsens when you add a check is measuring the denominator. Set blindness
composes: adding a check can only close holes.

## 2. The sets

| set | selected by | checks | span | accepts of 9 | **set blindness** | *audit* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule B *(earlier)* | population | 68 | 52% | — | — | *10%* |
| CEIL2 | **the reference** | 163 | 68% | **0** | **56.9%** | *0%* |
| FREE (convicts ≤2 of 7) | population | 167 | 70% | 1 (design B) | — | *13%* |
| **ZERO (convicts 0 of 7)** | **population** | **126** | **56%** | 1 (design B) | **99.8%** | ***0%*** |

CEIL2 is a **ceiling**, not a score: it is selected by asking the reference which
checks to keep. It is reported to bound what the corpus can do, exactly as the
goal permits golden to calibrate.

## 3. The golden-free soundness rule, and a retraction

The rule previously quoted here — *convicts at most 2 of the population* — was
measured 59 of 59 sparing the reference and called the best golden-free
soundness instrument. Re-run over all 594 corpus bodies instead of the 114 that
had been scored:

| golden-free rule | checks | *audit* |
|---|---|---|
| convicts **0** of 7 | **126** | ***0 = 0%*** |
| convicts 1 of 7 | 23 | *48%* |
| convicts 2 of 7 | 18 | *61%* |

**The step is at ZERO and it is sharp, not monotone.** A cut fitted at 2 on a
fifth of the corpus read as perfect and is 13% false-reject on the whole of it.

## 4. What the rule costs, which is the session's central result

    CEIL2   selected by the reference       set blindness  56.9%
    ZERO    selected golden-free            set blindness  99.8%

The golden-free set objects to **12 of 5,656** disagreements. The mechanism is
the rule itself: *convicts none of the population* is, by definition, *does not
discriminate on the population*. **Selecting for predictable soundness is
selecting for blindness — the same predicate read twice.**

## 5. What is nonetheless real

The ZERO set objects **11 times to design L**, which was held out of the seven
that selected it. Sound *and* discriminating on an unseen design, from a rule
that read no reference, is a property measured at 3–5% per check across this
project and never before obtained golden-free at set level.

## 6. Routes closed, each with the measurement that closed it

| route | result |
|---|---|
| more stimulus | **0** — every uncaught disagreement is on a testpoint the suite already runs, where two designs already differ. The evidence is present and the set is silent on it |
| re-authoring checks (39 calls, with a witness) | **0 cells newly reached.** The rewrites' objections were a strict subset of what the set already caught |
| selection over the whole corpus | **0** of 431 unused bodies close a hole while demonstrably sound. 296 close one; 288 convict the reference; 2 never decide on it |
| a golden-free completeness certificate | the pair instrument RANKS blindness at Spearman **+0.908** but its CLEAN cell is 5 of 8, and all five correct cleans are clean *by silence* |

## 7. The metric is validated against editor progress — a matched pair

Two editors, **the same unchecked starting design**, same model, same brief and
budget; the only difference is which set drove them.

| set | **blindness** | objections | testpoints differing | grade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CEIL2 163, reference-selected | 56.9% | 22 → 5 (−77%) | 279 → 190 (**−32%**) | `DIFFERS` |
| ZERO 126, golden-free | 99.8% | 11 → 1 (−91%) | 279 → 271 (**−3%**) | `DIFFERS` |

Both grades taken in a clean run directory with three miter pins green in the
same process. **The golden-free set spent 91% of its objections and moved the
design 3%.**

So set blindness is not a description of a set after the fact: it says in
advance how much of a design's divergence a loop driven by that set will close.
That was pre-registered before the second run was dispatched, and the run landed
on it. **This is the proxy metric the goal asks for — chosen by how well it
facilitates the editor succeeding, computable from spec-derived designs alone,
and validated against what the loop achieves rather than against how a set looks.**

*Trial counts are an output, not a confound: 10 of 21 and 19 of 21, neither
stopping for budget. A blinder set stops giving feedback sooner. Scope is two
runs — the gap is large and monotone, and two points do not establish a slope.*

## 8. The bottom line

**Completeness cannot be assured golden-free on this corpus.** The blindness
ranker is excellent and the soundness rule is perfect at n=126; composing them
yields a set that is sound, spans 56% of the specification, and is blind to
99.8% of the disagreements it is shown. The 288 corpus bodies that *do* close
holes all convict a correct design, so the missing instrument is the one twelve
routes have failed to build: something that separates a legitimate demand from
an over-strict one without a reference.

**Scope.** One design, one corpus of 594 bodies, one population of nine. Every
figure names its denominator. Nothing here is claimed for i2c, which remains
unmeasured because no i2c run retains traces.
